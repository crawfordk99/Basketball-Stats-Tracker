# Personal Basketball Stats Tracker

# Summary

I created this program to show my understanding of the 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
It creates a new file for every user named after them. It creates a dream team profile to simulate what it would be like if the user played for their favorite team. 
Then it calculates and writes to the file the person's stats. There's a lot of freedom here for the user. Do they want to keep track of their practice shots? 
Or do they play in a league, and want to keep track of their stats there? All the user has to do is keep track of their attempts, and whether they were 3pts, or 2pts. 
The program calculates their true shooting percentage (3pts are worth more, and therefore are weighted heavier than 2pts). The user also has the option to load 
their stats, keep track of their win-loss record in different type of basketball games, and delete their stats if they no longer wish to keep track of them.
